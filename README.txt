NOTICE!

This program is developed by students from University of Cebu: Banilad for the submission requirements of their Final semister.

Note addressed to our professor, Sir Derit regarding with the power-up system.

Good day Sir!

We are very sorry that we have not submitted the working files last Thursday, June 9, 2022. We hope that you
will still accept our submission and forgive us for the delay. For the past few weeks, we did everything we
got in compiling and building the project. Unfortunately we are not able to build a power-up system, we were
so close in building the function but it seems that we will be late in doing so.

However, we did what we can to make the game enjoyable and we want to give you a smooth and clean experience
of the game without compiling errors, bugs, and malfunctions of the game. With that, thank you for your time
and for teaching us Programming Logic and Design 2!
